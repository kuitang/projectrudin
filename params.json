{"name":"Matthew's Git Workshop Materials","body":"# Git Workshop\r\nThis is the set of instructions, labs, and follow-along-with-the-instructor script for Matthew McCullough's Git courseware.\r\n\r\nThis course is taught via [GitHub](http://github.com/training/online), [No Fluff Just Stuff](), [JAX](http://jax.de/2011/speaker/), [SDC](http://www.scandevconf.se/2011/conference/speakers/matthew-mccullough/), [33rd Degree](http://33degree.org/talks.html), [DevNexus](http://www.devnexus.com/s/presentations;jsessionid=F59B3B58DD63C314B6E17772A56A54D4), [JFokus](http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/page.jsp?id=traininggit) and many other conferences and [private events](http://ambientideas.com/training/).\r\n\r\n## Script\r\n\"The Git Workshop Student Instructions\" file is meant as both a shortcut guide to the common workflows of Git as well as a series of steps you can copy-and-paste from to follow along as Matthew presents the class materials.\r\n\r\n## Other Git Links\r\nIf you want to explore Git to a maximum depth, I recommend [Scott Chacon's free Git ebook, ProGit](http://progit.org/).
