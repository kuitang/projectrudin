>Show that if $ r \neq 0 $ is rational and $ x $ is irrational, then $ r + x $ and $ rx $ are irrational.

Suppose $ r + x = q \in \mathbb{Q} $. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field and $ r, q \in \mathbb{Q} $, we have $q - r = x \in \mathbb{Q}$, a contradiction.

Since $ r $ is rational, we have $ r = \dfrac{a}{b} $ for integers $ a, b $. If $ rx $ were rational, then $ rx = \dfrac{c}{d} $ for integers $ c, d $. Then $ rx = \dfrac{a}{b} x = \dfrac{c}{d} $, implying $ x = \dfrac{bc}{ad} $ is rational, a contradiction.
