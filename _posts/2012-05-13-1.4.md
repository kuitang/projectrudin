title: Upper bounds are no smaller than lower bounds.

>If $E$ is a nonempty subset of an ordered set and $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ while $\beta$ is an upper bound, show $\alpha \leq \beta$.

By definition, for $x \in E$, $\alpha \leq x \leq \beta$. The proof is a triviality: since the inequality holds for all $x$, we have $\alpha \leq \beta$ always.
