>Show that there is no rational number whose square is 12.

Since $ 12 = 4 \times 3 $ and $ 2^2 = 4 $, by a [previous exercise](/1.1.html), it suffices to show that there exists no rational $ q $ such that $ q^2 = 3 $.

We proceed as in Example 1. Suppose $ q $ were rational, so there exists relatively prime integers $m, n$ such that $q = m/n$. In particular, 3 does not divide both $m$ and $n$. Then $m^2 = 3 n ^2$, so $3 | m^2$. Then we must have $3 | m$, so $9 | m^2$. Then 9 also divides $3 n^2$, so $ 3 | n^2 \Rightarrow 3 | n$, a contradiction.
