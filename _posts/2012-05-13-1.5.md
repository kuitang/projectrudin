>Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ be bounded below, and let $-A = \\{ -x | x \in A \\}$. Show $\inf A = - \sup ( -A )$.

Suppose $\alpha = \inf A$. We will show $-\alpha = \sup ( - A )$. By definition of $\inf$, (i) for $a \in A$, we have $\alpha \leq a$, and (ii) if $\gamma > \alpha$, then $\gamma$ is not a lower bound of $A$. Now clearly $-\alpha$ is an upper bound of $-A$, since multiplying the inequality (i) by -1 gives us $-\alpha \geq -a$ for $-a \in -A$. Now suppose some $\beta < -\alpha$ were also an upper bound of $-A$. Then for $-a \in -A$, we have $-a \leq \beta$, so multiplying by -1, for $a \in A$, we have $-\beta \leq a$, so $-\beta$ is a lower bound of $A$. But $-\beta > \alpha$, contradicting the definition of $\inf$. So there is no $\beta < -\alpha$ which is also an upper bound for $-A$, so $-\alpha = \sup ( - A )$.
