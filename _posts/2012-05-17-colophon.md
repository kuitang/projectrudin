I created this website with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
and published it on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). The
site uses the Slate theme, by [Matthew
McCullough](https://github.com/matthewmccullough). I write in
[Markdown](http://www.mathjax.org/) with TeX, which
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) typesets. [DISQUS](http://disqus.com/)
provides comments offsite. You are of course welcome to use this
setup to write your own blogish math site. Just download the
repository.

You'll probably need a somewhat recent browser for all this to work.
[Let me know](mailto:kuitang@gmail.com) if it doesn't for you.

The whole project is inspired by [Project Crazy
Project](http://crazyproject.wordpress.com), a similar compendium
of solutions for Dummit and Foote's _Abstract Algebra_.

You can read the [manifesto](/manifesto.html) for my motivations
for this project.

Body text is typeset in [Crimson Text](http://aldusleaf.org/crimson.php)
and heading text is typeset in Lucida Grande.

The book problems are due to Rudin and are copyright by McGraw-Hill
Inc.  On this site, I have rewritten each problem in my own words.

The sources for the entire website is available as a [git
repository](https://github.com/kuitang/projectrudin/tree/gh-pages) for
anybody to inspect, fork and modify. 

_If you don't know about git, git is a [version control
system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control_system). It
keeps a "repository" of files, tracking how they change over time,
and by whom. [GitHub](http://github.com) hosts these repositories
for free, including this website. What that means is that you can
easily download your own copy of this site, make changes, and send
them back to me to be automatically incorporated._
