_And the [T.A.](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~krishna/) proclaimed,
"Spend a summer doing every problem is Baby Rudin. Then, do the
same for Papa Rudin."_

I'm a rising junior at Columbia. I'm not very good at math. The
classic way to get better at math is to do all of Rudin's problems.
Therefore, I am making my problem solving public to force myself
to work, and in the hope that somebody, somewhere in the world may
benefit from these solutions.

I also write about [stuff that is not math](http://kui-tang.com).

Lastly, forcing yourself to do every problem in a classic is the
best way to get better at math. Give this a try yourself!
