> If $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di$, show that the order relation defined by $z < w$ if $a < c$, or $a = c$ and $b < d$ (where latter comparisons are done in $\mathbb{R}$). Show that this $<$ makes $\mathbb{C}$ an ordered set. Do we also have the least-upper-bound property?

We prove each part of the definition:

1. Suppose $z < w$. If $z = w$, then $b = d$, contradicting that $b < d$. If $z > w$, then either $a > c$ or $a = c$ but $b > d$, also a contradiction.
2. Suppose $z = w$. If $z < w$, then $b < d$, contradicting that $b = d$. If $z > w$, then either $a > c$ or $a = c$ but $b > d$, contradicting that $a = b$ and $c = d$.
3. Symmetric to (1).

This ordering does induce the least-upper-bound property. Let $E \subset \mathbb{C}$ be nonempty and bounded above. Then the supremums $\alpha = \sup \\{ a | a + bi \in E \\}$ and $\beta = \sup \\{ b | \alpha + bi \in E \\}$ exist. Now $\alpha + \beta i$ is an upper bound for $E$, for if $c + di \in E$, then $c \leq \alpha$, and if $c = \alpha$, then $d \leq \beta$. Suppose $\gamma + \delta i < \alpha + \beta i$ were also a lower bound of $E$. Then $z = a + bi < \gamma + \delta i$ for $z \in E$. If $a < \gamma$, then $a < \gamma \leq \alpha$, contradicting the definition of $\alpha$. Otherwise, $a = \gamma \leq \alpha$ and $b < \delta \leq \beta$, giving a similar contradiction in $\beta$. So, $\alpha + \beta i = \sup E$.
