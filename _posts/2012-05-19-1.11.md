Put $r = |z| > 0$ and $w = z/r$. Then $z = rw$, and $|w| = |z|/r = |z|/|z| = 1$.

$w$ need not be uniquely determined: for $z = r = 0$, $w$ can take any value in the unit sphere about the origin. If $z \neq 0$, then $r$ is unique: $$|z| = |rw| = |r| = r$$ since $r \geq 0$. Moreover, $z$ lies on the ray $\{ r | r \geq 0 \}$, which intersects the circle \{ w | |w| = 1 \} at exactly one point, so $w$ is unique
