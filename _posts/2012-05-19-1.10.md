$$ \begin{aligned}
z^2 = (a+bi)^2 &= a^2 - b^2 +2abi \\\\
               &= \dfrac{|w|+u}{2} - \dfrac{|w|-u}{2} + 2\left[ \left( \dfrac{|w|+u}{2}\left( \dfrac{|w|-u}{2} \right) \right]^{1/2}i \\\\
               &= u + \left[|w|^2 - u^2\right]^{1/2}i \\\\
               &= u + (u^2 + v^2 - u^2)^{1/2}i \\\\
               &= u + vi \\\\
\end{aligned} $$

The proof for $v \leq 0$ is similar, and we end up with $z^2 = u - vi$.

Thus, every complex number, except for 0, has two complex square roots.
