1. The identity $b^n - a^n = (b - a)(b^{n-1} + b^{n-2}a + \ldots + a^n-1)$ gives a lower bound $b^n - a^n \geq n (b - a) \min_{i+j=n} \\{ b^i a^j \\}$. With $a=1$ and $b > 1$, the minimum is attained at $b^0 1^n = 1$, so $b^n - 1 \geq n(b-1)$.
2. This is immediate from (1), since $n$th roots exist and are unique.
3. Suppose $n > (b-1)/(t-1)$ but $b^{1/n} \geq t$. Multiply by $(t-1)$ and apply the inequality in part (2). Then $n(t-1) > b-1 \geq n(b^{1/n} - 1) \geq n(t-1)$, a contradiction.
4. Since $b^w < y$, we have $1 < yb^{-w} = t$. Since $yb^{-w} - 1 > 0$, by the Archimedean property, there exists an $n > 0$ such that $n(yb^{-w} - 1) > b - 1$. By (3), $b^{1/n} < t \Rightarrow b^{w + 1/n} < y$.
5. The proof is analagous to (4) with $t = y^{-1} b^w$. Since $b^w > y$, we have $t > 1$. By the Archimedean principle, $\exists n > 0$ such that $n(y^{-1}b^w - 1) > b - 1$. Then by part (3), $b^{1/n} < y^{-1} b^w$, so $y < b^{w - 1/n}$.
6. Suppose $b^x = y$. If $x \in A$, then $b^x < y$, a contradiction. So $x \notin A$. Since $A$ is unbounded below, $x$ must be an upper bound for $A$. It remains to show that $x$ is the least upper bound for $A$. Suppose $\alpha < x$ were another upper bound of $A$. Then there exists a $\beta$ such that $\alpha < \beta < x$. By monotonicity, $b^{\alpha} < b^{\beta} < b^x$. Then $\beta \in A$ and $\beta > \alpha$, so $\alpha$ is not an upper bound of $A$.
