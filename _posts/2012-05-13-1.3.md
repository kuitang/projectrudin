We really only use the closure under multiplication and existence of multiplicative inverse axioms. The inverse axiom says there exists $1/x$ such that $(1/x)x = 1$. Multiply both sides of $xy = xz$ by $1/x$ to get (a). Part (b) is a corollary of (a) with $z = 1$. Multiply $xy = 1$ by $(1/x)$ to get (c). To verify (d), multiply by $(1/x)$, giving $1 = 1$.
